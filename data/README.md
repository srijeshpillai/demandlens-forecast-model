This directory should contain the two required datasets to run the analysis:



1\.  `Sales Historical Data - 19th Sep 2025.csv`: The historical sales data for all mattress SKUs.

2\.  `Forecasting for Mattresses - Covid Data.csv`: The time series data for COVID-19 cases and deaths.



\*Note: Due to their size and proprietary nature, these data files are not included in the repository.\*
